                Map Reduce Framework- Word Count Porgram
    Steps in writing map reduce program::

1.Start eclipse, create a new java project (give name as wordcount)
2.we are developing a map reduce program, so we need to import the map reduce library jar files
    i.right click on wordcount project-> build path -> configure build path -> a popup opens
    ii.select libraries tab -> add external jars -> browse to the below folders and add only jar files.
         >hadoop installation dir -> share -> hadoop 
                   1.common 
                   2.common -> lib
                   3.hdfs
                   4.mapreduce
                   5.yarn
3.Write Mapper program, Reducer program and Driver program.
4.Make sure all errors are handled
5.Compile the java files and create a jar file
    i.right click on the project -> export -> select java->jar -> give a name to the jar file
6.run the jar file using command line clients hadoop jar or yarn jar command, below is the syntax.
     >yarn  jar   path_of_jarfile/jar_file_name.jar   
     >mainclassfilename(without .java or .class)   
     >inputfile_or_folder(args[0])   
     >output_folder_name(args[1])
